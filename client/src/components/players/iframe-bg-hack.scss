// HACK: if the color-scheme of a parent iframe is different from a child iframe, the child iframe will get an opqaue background
// this is a workaround to make the background transparent, it seems counter-intuitive but it works
// see: https://github.com/dyc3/opentogethertube/issues/1061
iframe {
	color-scheme: light;
}
