This folder contains a set of load tests using k6. The tests are written in JavaScript and can be run using the k6 CLI.

```
k6 run generate-rooms.js
```

Note that some tests require a little bit of setup to function properly (eg. creating a room before running the test). These need to be done manually before running the tests.
